# Allow the people to help to pay the national debt by donation, will , contribution, etc. 

People in this case include citizen and not citizen , Corporation and No Goverment Organization, Govermen Organization , from the United State or outside of the United State. 

The payment will be used to pay only for the principal (no the interest) of the national deb , and higher interest rate deb will be paid first if possible. 

The principal objective is to create awareness of the size of the national deb.

Payment can be once or recurrent depend of the way the person want to make the payment. It will be define no obligatory payment (nobody can't be force to pay for it) . 

Payment will be allow by any mean possible , by monetary transfer , or direct cash , digital currency. 

There are controversy relate to inheritance tax/Estate Tax(Dead tax): Some people suport it and other consider a bad idea (The Estate Tax is Double Taxation). One side  of the argument that only benefit the rich if remove , the other side how it will affect small company when the owner die and the inheritor need to paid for it that some of the time mean to sell asset and fire workers to be able to cover for it. This isn't design to finish this debate but will allow some of the proponent of Estate tax to add in their "will" a percent to paid for the national deb , the same way they do for charity. In the same time owner of small company will be able to adjust their own choosing percent of their will to pay for national deb that will no affect the continuation of his/her company when transfer to inheritor. 

They same that people have the right to contribute to charity or church they will have the right to help to pay for national deb.

Reason for contribution to pay for nationa deb : future generation don't have to pay consecuence of the present generation , to create estability , create hope for better future, reduce the posibility of goverment shutdown, appreciation of the history of this nation and contribution in the word, a form to support our way of life, a way to give a better chance to future generation, a choise to show support or the opposite, for politician to show how they are interested for the future of the nation, a way for deparment of government to move no used budget without loosing future funding, to help to have better options during trade war with other nations, to show awareness of the size of the national debt and the difficulty to pay for it. 

nota: this can be used for any nation with debt.  


sincerely
